# TRIANGLE/POINT

To test if a point is inside a triangle, we compare the area of the original triangle with the sum of the area of three triangles made between the point and the corners of the triangle.

Here's a diagram demonstrating the triangles created for a point outside and inside the triangle:

To get the area, we use [Heron's Forumula](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heron%27s_formula):

    float areaOrig = abs( (x2-x1)*(y3-y1) - (x3-x1)*(y2-y1) );

We need to calculate the area of the three triangles made from the point as well:

    float area1 =    abs( (x1-px)*(y2-py) - (x2-px)*(y1-py) );

float area2 = abs( (x2-px)_(y3-py) - (x3-px)_(y2-py) );
float area3 = abs( (x3-px)_(y1-py) - (x1-px)_(y3-py) );

If we add the three areas together and they equal the original, we know we're inside the triangle! Using this, we can test for collision:

    if (area1 + area2 + area3 == areaOrig) {
      return true;
    }
    return false;

Here's a full example:

    float px = 0;        // point (set by mouse)
    float py = 0;

    float x1 = 300;      // three points of the triangle
    float y1 = 100;
    float x2 = 450;
    float y2 = 300;
    float x3 = 150;
    float y3 = 300;


    void setup() {
      size(600,400);
      noCursor();

      strokeWeight(5);   // make point easier to see
    }


    void draw() {
      background(255);

      // mouse point to mouse coordinates
      px = mouseX;
      py = mouseY;

      // check for collision
      // if hit, change fill color
      boolean hit = triPoint(x1,y1, x2,y2, x3,y3, px,py);
      if (hit) fill(255,150,0);
      else fill(0,150,255);
      noStroke();
      triangle(x1,y1, x2,y2, x3,y3);

      // draw the point
      stroke(0, 150);
      point(px,py);  
    }


    // TRIANGLE/POINT
    boolean triPoint(float x1, float y1, float x2, float y2, float x3, float y3, float px, float py) {

      // get the area of the triangle
      float areaOrig = abs( (x2-x1)*(y3-y1) - (x3-x1)*(y2-y1) );

      // get the area of 3 triangles made between the point
      // and the corners of the triangle
      float area1 =    abs( (x1-px)*(y2-py) - (x2-px)*(y1-py) );
      float area2 =    abs( (x2-px)*(y3-py) - (x3-px)*(y2-py) );
      float area3 =    abs( (x3-px)*(y1-py) - (x1-px)*(y3-py) );

      // if the sum of the three areas equals the original,
      // we're inside the triangle!
      if (area1 + area2 + area3 == areaOrig) {
        return true;
      }
      return false;
    }

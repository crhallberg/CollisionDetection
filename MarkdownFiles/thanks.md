# THANKS
All of this code is thanks to lots of help online and off. As much as possible, I've tried to keep track of specific tutorials, forum threads, and posts that have contributed to specific examples. This would not have been possible without a ton of people sharing their great work.

Examples built from:

+ [Circle/Rectangle](circle-rect.php) made from this example by [Matt Worden](http://vband3d.tripod.com/visualbasic/tut_mixedcollisions.htm)
+ [Line/Point](line-point.php) via [this StackOverflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/a/17693146/1167783)
+ [Line/Circle](line-circle.php) via [Philip Nicoletti](http://www.codeguru.com/forum/showthread.php?threadid=194400)
+ [Line/Line](line-line.php) built from examples by [Paul Bourke](http://paulbourke.net/geometry/pointlineplane/) and [Ibackstrom](http://community.topcoder.com/tc?module=Static&d1=tutorials&d2=geometry2)
+ Too much time spent on [StackOverflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com)
+ p5.js port of the original Processing tutorials by Chris Hallberg

Also a big "thank you" to:

+ Ben Fry and Casey Reas, the creators of [Processing](https://processing.org/), and to the great community of creative people who use the language
+ Lauren McCarthy, the creator of [p5.js](https://p5js.org), and to the great community of developers, educators, and creative people who make up the incredible community around p5
+ This book was written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), made by John Gruber
+ [Prettify.js](https://github.com/google/code-prettify) for syntax highlighting
+ [SmartQuotes.js](http://smartquotesjs.com) for tidying up the typography
+ [JQuery](https://jquery.com/), [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info), and other free and open-source development tools used to make this project

And if you've found this code helpful in your projects, please do let me know!

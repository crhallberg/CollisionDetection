# WHAT YOU SHOULD ALREADY KNOW

This book's examples are written in [Processing](http://www.processing.org), a wrapper for the Java programming language. While you need only a little programming experience, you should understand how a basic Processing sketch is structured, how to use variables, how to draw shapes and get input from the mouse, and how `if/else` statements work.

It may be helpful to understand using `PVector` objects to store positions, but we'll cover the basics if you haven't used them before.

At the end, we will talk about using collision in object-oriented code. Understanding object-oriented programming will not be required to use this book, but it will be helpful for using these topics in larger projects with lots of objects hitting each other.

## FUNCTIONS

The core of the collision examples are _functions_, so you will need to be familiar with them to use this book. If you have never created a function, please read this section carefully; if you already understand this topic, you can skip ahead.

A function is a re-usable, self-contained piece of code. Functions are used for operations that you want to perform more than once, like checking for collision between two objects.

A function _returns_ (sends back) a variable _type_ (like `int` or `boolean`). For example, here's a function that returns the string "Hello!"

    String sayHi() {
    	return "Hello!";
    }

Note that when we declare the function, we list the variable type to be returned. The function does something useful, then sends data back using the `return` command. If the function doesn't need to return anything (for example, if all it does is draw a rectangle), the type is `void`. Sound familiar? The `setup()` and `draw()` sections of Processing are actually functions!

Functions can also receive _arguments_, or parameters that are fed into them. An argument is given a type and name (which exists only inside the function); multiple arguments are separated by commas. Here's a simple function that adds two numbers:

    int sum(int a, int b) {
    	return a + b;
    }

Once finished, you can use the function elsewhere in your code. For example, our `sum()` function above can be used like this:

    int result = sum(2, 2);
    println(result);
    >> 4

All of the examples in this book are functions. They are fed parameters of the objects to be tested (such as position or size) and return a `boolean` value whether or not a collision is happening. They could also be modified to return the position of the collision, such as in the [Line/Line](line-line.php) example. Be sure to look at the full code at the end of each example to see how the function is structured and called.

## FLOATS

You'll notice throughout this book that we use floating-point variables. This is for a few reasons.

First, it allows more flexibility for later use. Integers (whole numbers) can be passed into the functions readily, but the opposite would not be true.

    // int-to-float argument ok
    int a = 1;
    floatFunction(a);

    void floatFunction(float f) {
    	// Processing automatically converts to a float
    }


    // float-to-int argument not ok!
    float b = 1;
    intFunction(b);

    void intFunction(int i) {
    	// this will cause an error
    }

Second, floats give us the ability to measure more precisely and to move objects more smoothly across the screen. Finally, using floats smooths the transition from separate X/Y positions in our code to using the `PVector` class, as the more advanced examples will do. The numbers inside a PVectors are floats, so this ensures our functions can be easily tweaked to work with vectors.
